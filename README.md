Examples of Seaside Chats (data-centered meetings) from the Openscapes community

What are [Seaside Chats](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/)? They are regular meetings to deliberately discuss data workflows, develop overlapping skillsets, create shared systems for their labs, and cultivate an open culture in the research group.
